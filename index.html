							<h2>Why choose this topic?</h2>
							<p style = "color:white;">Being a massive football fan born in this generation, I am lucky enough to have grown up watching the greatest player of all time in the biggest sport of all time. I can say he is the greatest because it is true, my visualizations will provide statistics in various football related categories and show you how complete he is as a player. My aim is to first make the audience learn about the person behind the stats and then show you how dominant this player truly is in this sport.</p>

										<p style = "color:white;">Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a Rosario-based club.</p>

										<p style = "color:white;">Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi's parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several hundred dollars per month for the medication.</p>

										<p style = "color:white;">So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, and have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and moved across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through the junior system ranks.</p>

										<p style = "color:white";>Ultimately, Messi's short stature (5 feet, 7 inches), combined with his speed and relentless attacking style, has drawn comparisons to another famous Argentinian footballer, Diego Maradona.</p>

These marked the years before some of the best football the world has ever seen. </p>

							<p style = "color:white;">It is important to compare his earlier years with rest of his career because the perfect combination of coaching, positioning, and teammates brought this steady progression of a young player to a whole new level never seen before.</p>

							<p style = "color:white;">Before we discuss Lionel Messi's part in these four years of the best football that has ever been played. We must discuss the newly appointed manager of these four years, Pep Guardiola. </p>

							<p style = "color: white;"> In his four years, Guardiola’s men won 14 of the 19 competitions they entered, including six trophies in his first term, 2008/09: the Spanish Super Cup, La Liga and Copa del Rey, plus the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. The "Sextuple", a year of consistency that is so difficult that only two teams have ever done. Helping to revolutionise the game of football and re-popularise possession play at a time when football had shifted and become very defensive.</p>

							<p style = "color:white;">Messi won four consecutive Ballon d’Or in a row (2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012) during Barcelona's historic stretch. He become the second player in history to win a three consecutive Ballon’d’Or after France legend Michel Platini and the first ever to win four.</p>
							<p style = "color: white;"> A pass first player who is one of the greatest scorers to ever play the game. The intelligence of a deep-lying midfielder, the creativity of an attacking midfielder, the finishing of a refined number nine, and the dribbling of a number ten. Messi is the ultimate football player.</p>

										<p style = "color:white;">As I am presenting this, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is currently underway. It is potentially his last World Cup as a 35 year old, despite some suggestions by Messi himself saying, "I feel physically fit", hinting at another World Cup in a recent interview. In just a few days time, we could see Messi win the World Cup, something that has alluded him after getting incredibly close in 2014 losing the final. Potentially Messi could win the Champions League, the biggest club trophy that someone can win. On top of that, a World Cup or a Champions League trophy will solodify Messi as the best player of this year practically handing him his 8th Ballon D'or, awarded to the best player of the year.
										</p>

										<p style = "color:white;">Being the best player in the world at the moment, surpassing Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbaape who are in the prime of their lives. There is a lot of speculation and wondering as to where Messi could go next. A huge transfer that will surely bring all the attention in the sport towards the end of the season. Will he stay at Paris Saint Germain? Will he go back to FC Barcelona? Maybe adventure once again and go to Manchester City? Who knows?</p>

										<p style = "color:white;">I hope after all this I was able to provide you with enough statistics to understand what it truly takes to become one of the best in the biggest sport in the world. The line between being one of the best and definitively being the best in the world will always be subjective. No statistic is taken as that signifier, but for me, and now I hope for you, Lionel Messi is the Greatest Of All Time.</p>
