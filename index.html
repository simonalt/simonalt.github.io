							<h2>Why choose this topic?</h2>
							<p style = "color:white;">Being a massive football fan born in this generation, I am lucky enough to have grown up watching the greatest player of all time in the biggest sport of all time. I can say he is the greatest because it is true, my visualizations will provide statistics in various football related categories and show you how complete he is as a player. My aim is to first make the audience learn about the person behind the stats and then show you how dominant this player truly is in this sport.</p>

										<p style = "color:white;">Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a Rosario-based club.</p>

										<p style = "color:white;">Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi's parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several hundred dollars per month for the medication.</p>

										<p style = "color:white;">So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, and have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and moved across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through the junior system ranks.</p>

										<p style = "color:white";>Ultimately, Messi's short stature (5 feet, 7 inches), combined with his speed and relentless attacking style, has drawn comparisons to another famous Argentinian footballer, Diego Maradona.</p>
